## Dataset

> This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.


## Summary of Findings

> I make my exploration analysis of borrower APR against loan amount by looking at the impact of the Prosper rating. The multivariate exploration showed that the relationship between borrower APR and loan amount turns from negative to slightly positive when the Prosper ratings increased from HR to AA I ,then i visualize the rating and term effects on loan amount, it is showing that if you have good Prosper rating, the loan amount of all three terms will be increase


## Key Insights for Presentation

> there were a surprising interaction is that the borrower APR and loan amount is negatively correlated when the Prosper ratings are from HR to B, but the correlation is turned to be positive when the ratings are A and AA. Another interesting thing is that the borrower APR decrease with the increase of borrow term for people with HR-C raings. But for people with B-AA ratings, the APR increase with the borrow term.
